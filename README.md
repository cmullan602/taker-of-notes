## Description

I created this project for my unit 11 challenge in coding bootcamp. For the challenge we were given starting code to refractor and develop into a fully functioning note application. I struggled trying to get the application to even pull up at first. I felt like i had most of the code correct there were just a couple of tweeks that needed to be made. I also struggled getting the application deployed to heroku but I was able to do that as well.
